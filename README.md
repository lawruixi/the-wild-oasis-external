![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/26f8070c-59e4-4364-8da8-fe8b5030e3c1)

This is the sequel to the previous project, [The Wild Oasis](https://github.com/lawruixi/the-wild-oasis), which was a small project about an internal website made for the employees of a fictional company known as the Wild Oasis, for hotel sales. This project is instead a customer-facing website made using Next.js.

## Live Website
There is a live demo of this app, over here: https://the-wild-oasis-external.vercel.app

## Features
- Sign in using Google.
  - Update your account details, too.
- View a list of very nice=looking luxury cabins (dynamically loaded via Supabase's API)
  - These can be filtered by capacity.
- Reserve a slot for any of those luxury cabins.
- Check out all your reservations, and edit or delete them.
- Since this uses the exact same Supabase database as the previous project, you can use both projects at once and see the effects in real time! Cool stuff.
